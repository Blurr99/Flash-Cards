# Flash-Cards

Flashcards are a learning tool that consists of small cards, typically containing aquestion or prompt on one side and the corresponding answer on the other. They are used to aid in memorization and learning through repetitive exposure. Flashcards are commonly employed for studying various subjects, languages, vocabulary, math facts, and more. They provide a quick and focused way to test knowledge and reinforce concepts by presenting information in a concise and easily digestible format.


This project is created with the help of the Tkinter module in Python which allows one to create basic GUI applications

<ol>
  <li> 
        The project starts off with a card on the screen which displays a word in French and the user can press 2 buttons: cross or tick depending on whether they know the meaning of that word.

  </li>
  <li>
      If they press tick, when the app is launched again, that word doesnâ€™t come on screen ever again and if they press cross, next word comes on the screen, and if the user decides to wait, the card flips and displays the English translation of the French word allowing the user to broaden their French vocabulary.
